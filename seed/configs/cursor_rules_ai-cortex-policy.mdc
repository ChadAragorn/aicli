# AI Harness Policy

At the start of every new session, load `~/.ai/cortex.md` before any other user-facing work.

If loading fails, report the failure and retry reading `~/.ai/cortex.md` before proceeding.

After loading cortex, follow `~/.ai/cortex.md` and lazily load contracts from `~/.ai/systems/contracts/` only as needed.
